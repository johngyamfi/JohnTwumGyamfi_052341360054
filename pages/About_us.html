       <p style="color:aliceblue">Hi welcome to Living Lou. I celebrate all things food by creating simple, fresh and flavourful recipes to inspire others.
            If you’re like me and most of my readers, you’re a modern, busy and budget conscious foodie. Thank you for being here; 
            I’m so looking forward to being a part of your cooking journey. 
            I’ve been running Living Lou for twelve years and develop all of the recipes, shoot all of the photos and write every single blog post. 
            I’ve worked in the test kitchen of one of Canada’s leading women’s 
        lifestyle magazines and have had daily a food column in the newspaper, 
        Metro News.</p>
        <P style="color:aliceblue">You may have seen me on national television or giving cooking demos at Williams Sonoma and other events in Toronto.
            I have a bachelor’s degree in film and media and a Master’s in management. 
            If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch with me at livinglou@gmail.com– I love hearing from you!
             you! Please don’t hesitate to contact me at livinglou@gmail.com to chat. Opportunities include recipe development, food photography, sponsored posts, brand ambassador/sponsorship, video work, TV appearances, events and conferences</P>
         <h3 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><b>OUR PHILOSOPHY</b></h3>
         <p style="color:aliceblue">I believe that food should be simple, fresh and flavourful. It starts with real ingredients and simple techniques 
            to create meals worthy of both a Monday night and a social media share. 
            My recipes are vibrant and approachable, designed with speed, ease and simplicity in mind.
            But they are a step up from the everyday “ho-hum” meal. 
           </p>
           <P style="color:aliceblue">My recipes are globally inspired and developed not only to pique your interest 
            (and pin to your Pinterest board) but also to provide answers
            My goal is to fill up your “go-to” list with recipes that delight and inspired
            Living Lou in the Press</P>
           <P style="color:aliceblue"> Living Lou was chosen as Hill & Knowlton’s top 10 food blogs to follow as well as Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution Blog of the month.
             I have developed recipes for Metro News, Chatelaine, Today’s Parent and Walmart Live Better and have written 
            for multiple media outlets including Chatelaine.com, Cityline.ca, Thekit.ca and The College Prepster.
